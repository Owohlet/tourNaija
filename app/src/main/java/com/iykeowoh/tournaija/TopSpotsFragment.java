            "Mr. McCaughley, a Scot who first explored the mountain ranges in 1949. He camped " +
            "on the mountaintop of the Oshie Ridge on the Sankwala Mountains for a month before" +
            " returning with Mr. Hugh Jones a fellow rancher who, in 1951, together with" +
            " Dr Crawfeild developed the Obudu Cattle Ranch. Although the ranch has been through " +
            "troubles since, it has very recently been rehabilitated to its former glory. A recently " +
            "added cable car from the base to the top of the plateau gives visitors a scenic view while " +
            "bypassing the extremely winding road to the top.",

            "Tinapa is a business and leisure resort just north of Calabar, south eastern Nigeria associated " +
            "with the Calabar Free Trade Zone. It is being developed in four phases under a Private Public " +

            "and Central parts, with mangrove swamps on the coastal zones. Parts of the park belong to the Guinea-Congolian " +
            "region, with a closed canopy and scattered emergent trees reaching 40 or 50 meters in height.",

            "Yankari National Park is a large wildlife park located in the south-central part of Bauchi State, in northeastern " +

            "as well as a wide variety of flora and fauna. Its location in the heartland of the West African savanna makes it a unique way " +
            "for tourists and holidaymakers to watch wildlife in its natural habitat. Yankari was originally created as a game reserve in 1956, " +
            "but later designated Nigeriaâ€™s biggest national park in 1991. It is the most popular destination for tourists in Nigeria and, as such, " +

            "Located in a valley blanketed by tropical rain forest, the collection of caves has been in use over centuries by local people for whom it " +
            "has particular spiritual significance. This spiritual significance is still apparent, as the \"Ime Ogbe\" celebration is undertaken every year" +
            " to commemorate the discovery of the caves.\n" +
